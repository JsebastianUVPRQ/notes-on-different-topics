To succeed in quantum mechanics, especially in understanding the Schrödinger formalism, students need a strong grasp of differential equations. Here’s an overview of the essential types and techniques that students should be proficient in:

---

### 1. **First-Order Differential Equations**

Understanding first-order differential equations is foundational since they introduce concepts of solution techniques and stability, which will be useful later in higher-order differential equations.

#### **Standard Form**: 
A first-order differential equation has the general form:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x, y).
$$

#### **Separable Equations**:
If the equation can be written as $\frac{dy}{dx} = g(x)h(y)$, then it’s separable, meaning we can rewrite it as:
$$
\frac{1}{h(y)} \, dy = g(x) \, dx
$$
and integrate both sides.

#### **Linear First-Order Equations**:
These have the form:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} + p(x)y = q(x),
$$
which can be solved using an integrating factor $\mu(x) = e^{\int p(x) \, dx}$.

### 2. **Second-Order Linear Differential Equations**

Second-order differential equations are directly relevant to the Schrödinger equation and are widely used to model oscillations and wave phenomena in physics.

#### **Standard Form**:
A second-order linear differential equation looks like:
$$
\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + p(x) \frac{dy}{dx} + q(x)y = g(x).
$$
When $g(x) = 0$, it’s called a homogeneous equation; otherwise, it’s non-homogeneous.

#### **Homogeneous Second-Order Equations with Constant Coefficients**:
The simplest case is when $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are constants, leading to:
$$
\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + a \frac{dy}{dx} + b y = 0.
$$
This can be solved by assuming a solution of the form $y = e^{\lambda x}$, leading to the characteristic equation:
$$
\lambda^2 + a \lambda + b = 0.
$$
The nature of the roots $\lambda$ (real, complex, or repeated) dictates the form of the solution:
   - **Two distinct real roots**: $y(x) = C_1 e^{\lambda_1 x} + C_2 e^{\lambda_2 x}$.
   - **Repeated real roots**: $y(x) = (C_1 + C_2 x)e^{\lambda x}$.
   - **Complex roots**: If $\lambda = \alpha \pm i \beta$, then $y(x) = e^{\alpha x}(C_1 \cos(\beta x) + C_2 \sin(\beta x))$.

#### **Harmonic Oscillator and Complex Solutions**:
The quantum **2harmonic** oscillator is a key example that involves complex roots. For the equation:
$$
\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + \omega^2 y = 0,
$$
the solution is $y(x) = C_1 \cos(\omega x) + C_2 \sin(\omega x)$, which describes oscillatory behavior.

#### **Non-Homogeneous Equations**:
If the equation has a non-zero $g(x)$, such as:
$$
\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + a \frac{dy}{dx} + b y = g(x),
$$
one can solve it by finding a particular solution and adding it to the general solution of the associated homogeneous equation.

### 3. **The Method of Separation of Variables**

In quantum mechanics, separation of variables is particularly useful for solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation by separating spatial and temporal components. This method is typically applied when dealing with partial differential equations but is introduced with simpler ordinary differential equations.

#### **Example of Separation of Variables**:
For a separable equation, say
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)g(y),
$$
we rearrange it to:
$$
\frac{1}{g(y)} \, dy = f(x) \, dx
$$
and integrate each side independently.

### 4. **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)**

Quantum mechanics often involves partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly the Schrödinger equation. Proficiency in basic PDEs helps students approach the spatial and temporal parts of the Schrödinger equation.

#### **Types of PDEs**:
- **Heat Equation**: Models diffusion and is used to understand similar equations in probability.
  $$ 
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}.
  $$
- **Wave Equation**: Models oscillations and vibrations.
  $$
  \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}.
  $$
- **Laplace's Equation**: Appears in electrostatics and quantum boundary conditions.
  $$
  \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = 0.
  $$

#### **Schrödinger Equation as a PDE**:
The time-dependent Schrödinger equation in one dimension is:
$$
i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi(x, t)}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \psi(x, t)}{\partial x^2} + V(x) \psi(x, t),
$$
where $\psi(x, t)$ depends on both position $x$ and time $t$.

### 5. **Fourier Series and Fourier Transforms**

These techniques are crucial in quantum mechanics, especially for moving between position and momentum space representations of the wavefunction.

#### **Fourier Series**:
If a function is periodic, it can be expanded as a sum of sines and cosines:
$$
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left( a_n \cos\left(\frac{2 \pi n x}{L}\right) + b_n \sin\left(\frac{2 \pi n x}{L}\right) \right).
$$
donde los coeficientes ana_nan​ y bnb_nbn​ se calculan en términos de integrales definidas sobre el período de la función LLL:

$$a_n = \frac{2}{L} \int_{0}^{L} f(x) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n x}{L} \right) \, dx, \quad \quad b_n = \frac{2}{L} \int_{0}^{L} f(x) \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi n x}{L} \right) \, dx$$

Estos coeficientes determinan *cómo las ondas sinusoidales contribuyen a la construcción de $f(x)$.*
#### **Fourier Transform**:
[[The Fourier transform]] is essential for solving the free particle Schrödinger equation and for moving between position and momentum representations:
$$
\tilde{\psi}(k) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \psi(x) e^{-ikx} \, dx.
$$
The inverse Fourier transform then allows us to reconstruct $\psi(x)$ from $\tilde{\psi}(k)$.

### 6. **Special Functions and Series Solutions**

Some quantum mechanical problems, especially those with spherical or cylindrical symmetry, lead to differential equations that are solved by special functions.

#### **Legendre Polynomials and Spherical Harmonics**:
When solving for angular parts in spherical coordinates, the solutions are often Legendre polynomials $P_l(x)$ or spherical harmonics $Y_{lm}(\theta, \phi)$, which solve the angular part of the Schrödinger equation in central potentials.

#### **Hermite Polynomials**:
For the quantum harmonic oscillator, the solutions involve Hermite polynomials $H_n(x)$, which appear in the solution of the differential equation:
$$
\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} - 2x \frac{dy}{dx} + 2n y = 0.
$$

### 7. **Sturm-Liouville Theory**

Sturm-Liouville theory is useful for understanding eigenvalue problems and orthogonality of solutions, which are central to quantum mechanics.

#### **Sturm-Liouville Form**:
A differential equation is in Sturm-Liouville form if it can be written as:
$$
\frac{d}{dx} \left( p(x) \frac{dy}{dx} \right) + \left( \lambda w(x) - q(x) \right) y = 0,
$$
where $\lambda$ represents the eigenvalues. The solutions to Sturm-Liouville problems are orthogonal and form a complete set, which is essential for expanding quantum states in a basis of eigenfunctions.
