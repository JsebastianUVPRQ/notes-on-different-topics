Azure Data Studio provides a graphical user interface from managing many different database systems.
It currently provides connections to on premises SQL Server databases. 
Azure SQL Database, PostgreSQL, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, and SQL Server Big Data Clusters amongst others. 
It's an extensible tool, and you can download and install extensions from third party developers that connect to other systems, or provide wizards that help to automate many administrative tasks. 

SQL Server Management Studio provides a graphical interface. 
Enabling you to query data, perform general database administration tasks, and generate scripts for automating database maintenance and support operations. You can use SQL Server Management Studio to back up a database. You can also use it to generate transact SQL scripts for 
almost all of the functionality that SQL Server Management Studio provides. 
This gives the database administrator the ability to schedule and 
automate many common tasks. 

It's important to note that SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in databases. Microsoft Transact-SQL is a set of programming extensions from Microsoft 
that adds several features to the structured query language. 
Including transaction control, exception and error handling, row processing, and declared variables.
Azure SQL Database provides database services in Microsoft Azure, it's similar to SQL Server, except that it runs in the cloud. You can manage as your SQL database using the Azure portal. 
Typical configuration tasks such as increasing the database size, creating a new database, and 
deleting an existing database can be done using the Azure portal. You can use the Azure portal to dynamically manage and adjust resources, such as the data storage size and the number of cores available for the database processing. These tasks would require the support of a system administrator if you were running a database on premises.
